## issues

If you get an unsupported File System or Git name in the history, it may make so the only ways to fix a resulting issue would be:
* To "Undo Last Commit" all the later Commits .
* To copy the content and re-Commit it .

Max names:
* Branch -- close to ``1aA`!@#$%&()-_=+{]};'.,`` .
* File System -- ``1aA`~!@#$%^&()-_=+[{]};'. ,`` , Without ending folder names on `.` , that would break some interaction with the subject repository on Windows .


## Gitignore

`.gitignore` files -- each line : new item
* separators for items of paths is required to be written as `/` .
* from location of the file -- `/<<path>>` .
	
	!! otherwise it'll be considered as all files/folders with that name .


## Branches / Tags

Among other, they specify which Commits with the preceding ones, are not Detached .

If you cancel Rebase while have not Committed changes, the 2nd will be lost .

They use the settable names, for separation from each other .

If you do "Undo Last Commit" on Rebase Commit . It may break your ability to Commit, in that case save the changes you had not Committed before the Rebase, then switch to the subject Branch, and try again .

The only Tag 's difference seems to be the handling by interface programs, for example Github uses them as paths to releases (so they work even not being listed on the Releases page) .


## Management

If you have a sub-Repository, Committed without {separate Remote}/Submodules . And delete `.git` from it . You'll need to Commit a deletion of the folder, for it's content to be processed, and `.gitignore` at the time doesn't work for this .

!!! If you want to do "Undo Last Commit" on the Repository's 1st Commit:
1. Make Branch at the Commit, and select it .
2. Do the action and do not close the Git/program .
3. Make a Commit .

* Otherwise the Repository will break, with no way to restore the content .
